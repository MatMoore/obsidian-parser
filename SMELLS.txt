Bad naming

- MarkdownParser does more than parse markdown - it takes a file from the vault and parses it into an object that can be inspected
- The document argument of ParsedMarkdownDocument is very vague

Huge classes

- Page has lots of optional arguments that should not really be optional
- Could perhaps extract out some graph behaviour to a mixin
